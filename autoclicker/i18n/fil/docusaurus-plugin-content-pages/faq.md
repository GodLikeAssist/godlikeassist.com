# Frequently Asked Questions

## 1. What to Do

### 1.1 Auto-clicker not working?

If the auto-clicker fails to start, it means the accessibility permission is not enabled or has expired. Close and restart the accessibility service to fix it.

**Usage method** - `For example, in multi-target mode`

1. Enable multi-target mode, click the "+" in the floating menu that appears to add click targets, and move them to the appropriate positions.
2. Set the delay intervals and durations for the click targets (the smaller the value, the faster the clicking speed).
3. Click the play button on top of the floating menu to start auto-clicking.

### 1.2 Click speed not fast enough?

There are two ways to solve this:

1. Before starting the auto-clicker, please enter the default settings and change the speed preset to fast (1 millisecond), then run the auto-clicker.
2. After starting the auto-clicker, click on a target to modify its delay interval and duration (the smaller the value, the faster the clicking speed).

### 1.3 Unable to stop the auto-clicker?

You can press the power button to turn off the screen; the auto-clicker will stop running once the screen is off.

### 1.4 Auto-clicker stops after running for a while?

1. When the set interval is less than 40 milliseconds, mobile devices do not have enough response time, which may cause the auto-clicker to fail. It is advised not to run fast clicking for long periods or to appropriately increase the interval time.
2. When the phone's battery consumption increases rapidly, the system may close background apps. You can resolve this issue through [Auto Start](https://dontkillmyapp.com/) and [Ignore Battery Optimization Permission](https://dontkillmyapp.com/).

> If the above methods do not resolve the issue, you can restart the app.

### 1.5 Auto-clicker still won't open after enabling accessibility permission?

1. Ensure the accessibility permission is correctly enabled.
2. Disable the accessibility permission and then re-enable it, or close and restart the application.

> If the problem persists, please restart your phone.

## 2. Why

### 2.1 Always need to restart accessibility permission?

Accessibility permission is a system permission, and Android has strict requirements for it. We have no control over it.
However, you can resolve this issue by setting [Auto Start](https://dontkillmyapp.com/).

### 2.2 Unable to click or swipe the screen while the auto-clicker is running?

Since the auto-clicker operates at high speeds, if you control the screen while it is running, the phone screen may not recognize your gestures.

> If you need other gestures, it is recommended to pause the auto-clicker first, or add more click or swipe targets to solve this.
